### First assignment:

It took me about six hours, and I presented what I did in front of the class at the start of the second week.

- Style the login screen for twitter

Put the background image, and built a login button using only drawables. The button does not completely look like the one in the mock, but I later discovered the mock button is actually an image. Still, it was fun trying to make it as a drawable.

- Pick a good Twitter launcher icon

Done

- Properly theme the ActionBar with correct text and background colors

- Theme the tabs to fit a "twitter" color scheme
